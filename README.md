# components-demo

The goal of this repo is to experiment with component architecture, accessibility and documentation, with the hope of defining some patterns and strategies that can be used in a component library repo.

1. Create the following components using native elements only:

- Label
- Input
- Select
- Form fields: Input, Select (containing both the base component, label and wrapper for formatting in a form layout)

2. Create documentation for all components

- Define a consistent format for documenting the available API and functionality for each component

3. Add RadixUI and compare the Select component to the Radix version to the native implementation
